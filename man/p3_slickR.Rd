\description{
use slick.js library in R
}
\details{
slick.js \url{http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/} is an image carousel javascript library. To find all the attributes
that can be used please refer to the link. To create more than one carousel input the attributes into a nested list eg
slickOpts=list(list(slidesToShow=1,slidestoScroll=1,arrows=F,fade=T),
list(slidesToShow=3,slidesToScroll=1,dots=T,focusOnSelect=T,centerMode=T)). It is possible to synchronize the slides
through the slickOpts calls, using asNavFor attribute. To replace the dots with icons use the dotObj argument to pass in the icon
images and in the slickOpts add a customPaging attribute with the appropriate JS(.) function call. The slideType accepts the type
of html DOM you want to be in the slide, eg img, iframe.
