\title{Radar Chart}
\usage{
p3_radar_chart(dataset, axis_categories, data_names = NULL,
  colors = NULL, radar_levels = 5, width = NULL, height = NULL,
  elementId = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{List of numeric vectors containing the datasets to be
plotted.}

\item{axis_categories}{List of characters for the axis labels}

\item{data_names}{List of characters defining the actual names of each data
defined in the dataset}

\item{colors}{Named list with colors for the data series in the chart.
NULL results in an random automatically generated colors.}

\item{radar_levels}{Numeric value of the radar (circle) level for the chart}

\item{width, height}{Must be a valid CSS unit (like '100%', '400px', 'auto')
or a number, which will be coerced to a string and have
'px' appended.The default is NULL, which results in
intelligent automatic sizing based on the chartâ€™s
container.}

\item{elementId}{Use an explicit element ID for the widget Useful if you
have other JavaScript that needs to explicitly discover
and interact with a specific widget instance. in any
other case leave as NULL which results in an
automatically generated one.}
}
\value{
Radar Chart.
}
\description{
Plots multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or
 more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point
}
