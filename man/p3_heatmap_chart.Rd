\usage{
p3_heatmap_chart(dataset, data_names = NULL, width = NULL,
  height = NULL, elementId = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{List of vectors containing the datasets to be
plotted.}

\item{data_names}{List of characters defining the actual names of each data
defined in the dataset}

\item{width, height}{Must be a valid CSS unit (like '100%', '400px', 'auto')
or a number, which will be coerced to a string and have
'px' appended.The default is NULL, which results in
intelligent automatic sizing based on the chartâ€™s
container.}

\item{elementId}{Use an explicit element ID for the widget Useful if you
have other JavaScript that needs to explicitly discover
and interact with a specific widget instance. in any
other case leave as NULL which results in an
automatically generated one.}
